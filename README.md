### What is ft_server?

This project is intended to introduce you to the basics of system and network administration. It will allow you to install a complete web server, using a deployment technology named Docker.

### What we have there?

 - Must set up a web server with **Nginx,** in only one docker container. The container OS must be **Debian** buster.
 - The web server must be able to run several services at the same time. The services will be a **WordPress** website, **phpMyAdmin** and **MySQL**. Need to make sure that the SQL database works with the WordPress and phpMyAdmin.
 - The server should be able to use the **SSL** protocol.
 - Have to make sure that, depending on the url, the server redirects to the correct website.
 - Also need to make sure the server is running with an autoindex that must be able to be disabled.
